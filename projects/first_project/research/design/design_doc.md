# Project Design Document

## Project Title

- Historical Significance of the Relocation of the National Southwestern Associated University and Visualization of the Relocation Route

## Project Files

- [Research Journal](../journal/research_journal.md)

## Background and Context (the W's)

- Who: Students and instructors from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and so forth.
- When: During the Anti-Japanese War.
- Where: From Changsha province to Yunnan province.
- What: The relocation and merger of a higher education institution, which was called The Southwest Associated University.
- Why: After the full-scale outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in order to prevent Chinese education from the ravages of invasion, some universities in North China and coastal cities had to relocate inland, among which was the Southwestern Associated University.

## Research Puzzles

- How was the choice of the relocation route for Southwest Associated University influenced by factors such as the war situation, geography, and educational resources?
- What profound implications has the relocation brought to the university for its own educational survival, academic research, and so forth?
- What elements or designs should be included in a visualized roadmap to enable users to clearly understand the content of the roadmap?

## Methodology

- Literature Method
- Data Collection
- Python

## Data and Sources

- Select key cities by reading primary and secondary resources.
- Use navigation apps to match longitude and latitude of each city.

## Expected Outputs

- An interactive relocation route map.
- A paper analyzing the historical significance of relocation.

## Working hypotheses

- The relocation routes can be classified into three types according to the moving methods.
- This roadmap will be dynamic, and the three visualized routes will be presented in chronological order respectively.

## Challenges and Risks

My digital technology skills are not proficient enough, and I may not be able to display the routes in chronological order  dynamically. Besides, changing the background map of the relocation routes into a former map is also challenging.

## Action Items

- [1] Collection of literature and historical sources:
- [2] Data collection and processing
- [3] Roadmap visualization
- [4] Analysis of the Significance of Relocation
