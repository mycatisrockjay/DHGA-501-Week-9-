The relocation of the Southwestern Associated University facilitated the preservation of Chinese culture. During the university's fourth anniversary celebrations, Huang Zijian, dean of the normal school, mentioned in his report on the establishment process that students from the walking team had gained rich insights while collecting folks in Xiangxi and Guizhou. Jin Weiwei et al. conducted a study on Liu Zhaojí's compilation, _Collection of Southwestern Folk Ballads_. They concluded that this collection conveyed the local customs and folk culture encountered along the route from Changsha to Kunming. The walking team's research into these ballads offered a deeper understanding of China's folk culture, enriching and supplementing the historical records of ethnic cultures. The teachers and students of the walking team transformed their journey into a process of cultural documentation, which enables the recording and preservation of folk ballads that had previously existed only through verbal means. This process achieved the conversion of intangible folk culture into a tangible form. It demonstrates that the relocation was not merely a spatial change but also became a crucial protection of folk culture.
